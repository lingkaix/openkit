# @openkit/protocol

`@openkit/protocol` defines shared OpenKit Core schemas, request payloads, event envelopes, and JSON Schema outputs for product surfaces, public transport projections, and runtime adapters that project into stable OpenKit protocol records.

The TypeScript and Zod schemas in this package are the machine-readable source of truth for stable shared protocol records. Generated JSON Schema files are same-release projections that preserve representable structural constraints; when standard JSON Schema cannot express a Zod cross-field refinement, the generated artifact documents that boundary and consumers must use the canonical Zod schema for authoritative validation. App-specific read models, transport routes, and runtime-native payloads remain projections outside the package.

## Scope

- Core protocol records, commands, events, errors, and conformance fixtures.
- TypeScript and Zod schema sources.
- Generated JSON Schema outputs derived from the Zod source.

## Commands

- `pnpm --filter @openkit/protocol test`
- `pnpm --filter @openkit/protocol typecheck`
- `pnpm --filter @openkit/protocol build`
